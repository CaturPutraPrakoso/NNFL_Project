To complete the project we need to do these tasks.

1) create data.
2) create an initial population of chromosomes where weach chromosome stores coordinates of 3 centroids in binary representation.
3) start ga and call the crossover(+tournament selection), mutation, elitism functions.
4) call the fcm function on the new generation. Fcm function calculates the membership values and the new centroid. Call the fitness function.
5) store the fitness values and best cases.
6) repeat step 3-5 for the given number of generations.
